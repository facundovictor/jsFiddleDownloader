To download a single fiddle from its id:

```
  jsfiddle-downloader -i <fiddle-id> [-o <output file>] [-f]
```

To download a single fiddle from its url:

```
  jsfiddle-downloader -l <url> [-o <output file>]
  jsfiddle-downloader -l jsfiddle.net/<user>/<fiddle-id>
  jsfiddle-downloader -l jsfiddle.net/<user>/<fiddle-id>/<version>
  jsfiddle-downloader -l https://jsfiddle.net/<fiddle-id>
  jsfiddle-downloader -l https://jsfiddle.net/<fiddle-id>/<version>
  jsfiddle-downloader -l https://jsfiddle.net/<user>/<fiddle-id>/show/ -o myfiddle.html
```

To download all scripts of a determinated 'user' from jsFiddle.net:

```
  jsfiddle-downloader -u <user> [-o <output file>]
```

It'll download all backups in the currrent directory, the jsFiddles scripts will be named as:

```
  [<output-folder>/]<id-fiddle>.html
```

To save the files using the fiddle's title, provide the parameter `-t` (Note: This is only supperted when using `--user`):

```
  jsfiddle-downloader -t -u <user> [-o <output file>]
```

It'll download all backups in the currrent directory, the jsFiddles scripts will be named as:

```
  [<output-folder>/]<title-fiddle>.html
```

To avoid running a local server for resolving URIs that doesn't have an URI method defined. Use the `-f` parameter:

```
  jsfiddle-downloader -f -i <fiddle-id>
  jsfiddle-downloader -f -l <url>
  jsfiddle-downloader -f -u <user>
```

This will replace all the `http://` in the href of link tags and in the src of script tags.
